### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tony Ward

I'm a frontend-focused Software Engineer. Despite my username being `ynotdraw`, I have absolutely zero skills drawing! It's my first and last names spelled backwards ðŸ™ƒ.  I enjoy the following:

- Building design systems with cool designer folk
- EmberJS
- React
- TailwindCSS
- CSS
- Sass
- Doing my best with web accessibility

I enjoy talking at meetups and conferences in my limited spare time.  I spoke at EmberConf once with a mini talk and it was a blast.
